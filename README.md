# xcx

Charli xcx clips of audio that you can play on repeat. Just fun parts in charli songs that I like.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

To run the app in development mode you can run `npm start` in the project directory.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

To deploy run `npm run deploy`.

Your app will deploy to [https://gabrieltal.github.io/xcx](https://gabrieltal.github.io/xcx).

To build the app for production to the build folder, run `npm run build`. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### Tests

Run `npm test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
